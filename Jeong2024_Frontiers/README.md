 Human perceptual ability can be improved by perceptual learning through 
repeated exposure or training. Perceptual learning studies have focused on 
achieving accurate perception of stimuli by improving perceptual sensitivity. 
However, eliminating illusions can also be one of the ways of accurate 
perception. To determine whether the illusion can be attenuated by perceptual 
learning, the current study used a tilt illusion where the orientation of the grating 
presented in the center (central grating) was misperceived because of the 
orientation of the grating presented in the periphery (surrounding grating). In 
Experiment 1, participants were trained either in the illusion training condition, in 
which they trained with illusory stimuli presenting both surrounding and central 
gratings together, or in the control training condition, where only the central 
grating was presented. The results confirmed that the tilt illusion was reduced 
only in the illusion training condition. Experiment 2 tested the transfer effect of 
learning, which is not often observed in perceptual learning. During training, the 
orientation of the surrounding grating was fixed to see whether the elimination 
of the illusion also occurred in the surrounding grating with an orientation that 
was not used during training. A decrease in the illusion was found only in the 
case of a surrounding grating with trained orientations, and not in the case of 
surrounding gratings with untrained orientations. These results suggest that the 
reduction in tilt illusion through training is due to perceptual learning.
